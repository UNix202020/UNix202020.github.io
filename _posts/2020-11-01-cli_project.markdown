This is my first CLI project! I really enjoyed learning about how a CLI app is designed and how using an API helps in the process. 

For my CLI project, I used Studio Ghibli's API to allow the user of my app to learn about Studio Ghibli characters. The app allows users to request information about characters and then returns their name and a set of characteristics about each individual.

I really enjoyed seeing what I learned in this module coming together to make this project function.
