The day has finally arrived, and I'm so excited to be back!!! It's been about 5 months since I had to pause my Flatiron experience, due to the outbreak of covid-19, being forced to move unexpectedly (which was related to the virus outbreak and everybody's hightened sense of anxiety at the time), and what felt then like all hell broke loose. In the months since the outbreak started, I've experienced a lot of changes and challenges, but I'm determined to see this career goal through to completion. How did I get here? I'm mostly self-taught. I got hooked on coding gradually, through free online resources like codecademy.com, library books, and a few contractor jobs where I learned how to set up web pages and embed video and other content. Using code as a freelancer was what gave me the confidence to pursue coding as a career option, and I realized that a hobby can become more than just a fun way to experiment. My goal is to take what I already know and build on it so I can work full-time with code. As the saying goes, do what you love!
